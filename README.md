# Staff Productivity Analysis (KPI + Revenue Modeling)

This project analyzes encounter-level service data to measure employee productivity, client engagement, and revenue contribution over time.

It demonstrates how operational service logs can be transformed into clear, business-focused KPIs for performance evaluation and financial analysis.

Note: This repository uses synthetic/de-identified data. No real client data or private records are included.

---

## Project Goals

This analysis answers the following questions for a single provider:

- How many direct client hours were delivered each month?
- How much revenue was generated each month?
- How do productivity and revenue trend over time?
- How do the hours and revenue compare to utilization goals?
- What is the cost-benefit analysis of the employee including a proposed pay raise?

---

## Data

The dataset is a synthetic version of an encounter export modeled after typical service-based operational logs.

Expected columns:

- encounter_date
- encounter_type
- cpt_code
- duration_min
- is_billable (Yes/No)
- encounter_status (Complete/InProgress)
- employee_id

File location:

data/sample_monthly_data.csv

## KPI Definitions

Client Hours (Monthly)  
client_hours = sum(duration_min) / 60

Units (Time-Based Codes, 15-Minute Increments)  
units = floor(duration_min / 15)

Revenue (Monthly)  
Time-based services:  
revenue = sum(units * billing_rate)

Per-encounter services:  
revenue = sum(encounters * billing_rate)

Revenue per Client Hour  
revenue_per_hour = monthly_revenue / monthly_client_hours

Cost–Benefit Ratio (Optional)  
roi = monthly_revenue / monthly_compensation

---

## Results
